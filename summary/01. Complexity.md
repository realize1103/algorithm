# Complexity
- To show the performance of an algorithm
  - Time Complexity :  Analysis of the execution time of the algorithm
  - Space Complexity : Analysis of the algorithm's memory usage
## Big-O Notation
Big-O time is the language and metric we use to describe the efficiency of algorithms. 
``` python
array = [3,1,2,5,4]
summary = 0
for x in array:
  summary += x
```
Time Complexity : O(N)
